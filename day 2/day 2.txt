a. WHERE clause: After joining. Records will be filtered after join has taken place.
b. ON clause - Before joining. Records (from right table) will be filtered before joining.
 This may end up as null in the result
 
natural join 
the sql is responsible to find the join condition by its own
natural join and inner join are bit similar
it just join based on the column name not considering the relationship of the columns
in the different table. 
if there is no exact same names matchs in column name 
it will do a cross join between the tables
if the tables have more than one column sharing the same name then it will join all the columns with same names


inner,left,right,self join are widly used joins
whe we want ot match one record from the table with other record of the same table here we use self join.
