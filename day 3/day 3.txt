day 3:
outer query/main (sub query/inner query)
execute the sub first the outer query is executed
the sub query is executes once and the results of subquery is used by main query

types of subquery:

query with no relation with outer query
a,scalar subquery - return one row and column
b,multiple row subquery - return multiple rows  
 1,multiple rows+ multiple columns
 2,multiple rows+ one column 

query related to the outer query
c,correlated subquery -  

d,nested subquery


select(https://dbfiddle.uk/pyvRjnLJ),from,where,having these are the clauses can use the subquery

using subquery inside select must be a scalar
avoid using select query inside a select clause, alternatively use join

insert(https://dbfiddle.uk/nPo7chWw),update(https://dbfiddle.uk/yxqvT9Az),delete(https://dbfiddle.uk/yxqvT9Az) 		


exist vs in clause:
 you should use the EXISTS operator when you need to check if any rows exist in a table that meet a certain condition. You should use the IN operator when you need to check if a column value exists in a list of values.
